 * critnib.c -- implementation of critnib tree
 *
 * It offers identity lookup (like a hashmap) and <= lookup (like a search
 * tree).  Unlike some hashing algorithms (cuckoo hash, perfect hashing) the
 * complexity isn't constant, but for data sizes we expect it's several
 * times as fast as cuckoo, and has no "stop the world" cases that would
 * cause latency (ie, better worst case behaviour).

/*
 * STRUCTURE DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Critnib is a hybrid between a radix tree and DJ Bernstein's critbit:
 * it skips nodes for uninteresting radix nodes (ie, ones that would have
 * exactly one child), this requires adding to every node a field that
 * describes the slice (4-bit in our case) that this radix level is for.
 *
 * This implementation also stores each node's path (ie, bits that are
 * common to every key in that subtree) -- this doesn't help with lookups
 * at all (unused in == match, could be reconstructed at no cost in <=
 * after first dive) but simplifies inserts and removes.  If we ever want
 * that piece of memory it's easy to trim it down.
 */

/*
 * CONCURRENCY ISSUES
 *
 * Reads are completely lock-free sync-free, but only almost wait-free:
 * if for some reason a read thread gets pathologically stalled, it will
 * notice the data being stale and restart the work.  In usual cases,
 * the structure having been modified does _not_ cause a restart.
 *
 * Writes could be easily made lock-free as well (with only a cmpxchg
 * sync), but this leads to problems with removes.  A possible solution
 * would be doing removes by overwriting by NULL w/o freeing -- yet this
 * would lead to the structure growing without bounds.  Complex per-node
 * locks would increase concurrency but they slow down individual writes
 * enough that in practice a simple global write lock works faster.
 *
 * Removes are the only operation that can break reads.  The structure
 * can do local RCU well -- the problem being knowing when it's safe to
 * free.  Any synchronization with reads would kill their speed, thus
 * instead we have a remove count.  The grace period is DELETED_LIFE,
 * after which any read will notice staleness and restart its work.

/*
 * A node that has been deleted is left untouched for this many delete
 * cycles.  Reads have guaranteed correctness if they took no longer than
 * DELETED_LIFE concurrent deletes, otherwise they notice something is
 * wrong and restart.  The memory of deleted nodes is never freed to
 * malloc nor their pointers lead anywhere wrong, thus a stale read will
 * (temporarily) get a wrong answer but won't crash.
 *
 * There's no need to count writes as they never interfere with reads.
 *
 * Allowing stale reads (of arbitrarily old writes or of deletes less than
 * DELETED_LIFE old) might sound counterintuitive, but it doesn't affect
 * semantics in any way: the thread could have been stalled just after
 * returning from our code.  Thus, the guarantee is: the result of get() or
